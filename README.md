Well, i was tired of creating tables each time for each client, so i created a script, pff i told AI to make it simple code, just connecting to cloud sql server (google - instance of mysql)
Defined in the .env the named of schemas that i want to pick also configs of which schemas and tables i want to create (every bussines has differents scopes that may not need al the tables that we developed so far..)
